## Planning for Drunks

These files make up the final agent-based model for assignmnet 2 of GEOG5990 module. The model successfully simulates drunks leaving a pub as the centre of the map and walking around, taking steps in random directions, until they reach their home.

The data needed to run the model is:
1. drunk.txt (the environment data)
2. drunk_framework.py (the class code)
3. drunks.py (the main model code)

The drunk_framework.py file must be run first followed by the drunks.py. This will begin the model and it will run untill all 25 drunks have returned to their home. A new file called drunk_density.txt will also be created and shown following the completeion of the model. This file shows how many times each cell has been walked over by the drunks.
