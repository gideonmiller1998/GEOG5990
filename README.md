# Geog5990
assignmemt 1 project

This is the repository for the Agent-Based model code as part of the GEOG5990 module. The three files necessary to run the model are: model.py, agentframework.py and in.txt. All other files show the progress made at each step to these final files. The agents in the model randomly move around the environment and eat away at the data, sharing with the other agents in their neighbourhood when certain thresholds are met, and finally depositing back into the environment. In real life terms this can be thought of as sheep wandering around a field eating grass and returning it back to the environemnt as animal waste. The GUI allows the user to give a number of agents, a number of iterations and a stopping condition. The stopping condition is a number between 0 and 1. At each iteration a random number is created and if the stopping condition specified in the GUI is lower than the random number the model will end. If this stopping condition is not reached the model will run untill the number of iterations is met. The code has been appropriately licensed.
